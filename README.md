# Grove of the Ancients Core Engine


## Installation

This is Mac-Specific

```bash
brew install portaudio
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

NOTE: Every terminal you open needs to have the virtual environment activated. 
      You can do this by running `source .venv/bin/activate` in the terminal.
      The other steps (creating the virtual environment and installing the requirements) only need to be done once.
